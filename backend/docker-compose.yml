# This is a docker compose file for defining and running
# multi-container environments. It simplifies the control
# of your application stack into a single configuration
# file. The following commands are useful:
#
#   docker compose up          - "runs" the entire system
#   docker compose up --build  - force a build and "runs" system
#   docker compose up -d       - "runs" system in detacted mode
#   docker compose down        - "closes" the entire system and deletes everything
#   docker compose stop        - stop running containers without removing them
#   docker compose start       - start previously stopped containers
#
